# Roadmap

This attempts to describe a roadmap for any upcoming versions and development.

## Pre-2.8

- Update toolchain and test suite so they can pass locally
  See about tests passing in cloud config/travis
- Review open Issues/Pull requests and classify as bug vs improvement, assign to milestones
- Review existing COOK tickets with [this filter](https://tickets.chef.io/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+COOK+AND+status+in+%28Open%2C+%22In+Progress%22%2C+Reopened%29+AND+component+%3D+nginx+AND+project+%3D+COOK+ORDER+BY+updated+ASC%2C+key+DESC)
  attempt to close out as many as possible, especially
- Rework CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect non-Chef Software maintainers
- Rework TESTING.md to reflect actual testing method
- Apply stylistic choices to codebase

## Version 2.7.5

- Toolchain updates for current versions
- Test suites pass on CentOS & Ubuntu Long-Term Supported versions
- Any new documentation and test suites
- Any currently open bugs/pull requests fixing bugs

## Version 2.8

- Any new behaviors/functionality/feature introduced in current pull requests.

## Version 3.0

- Anything we can think of that we want to change.
  Please Fork/Edit/PullRequest ideas to this list with some context and reasoning.
