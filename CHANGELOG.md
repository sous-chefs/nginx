- passenger Ubuntu 18.04 support
- Evaluate ohai_plugin_enabled in the source recipe
- Abstract nginx users home path to attribute

## 8.1.5 (2018-07-23)

## 7.0.0 (2017-09-18)

### Breaking Changes

- This release of the nginx cookbook merges all changes that occurred within the chef_nginx fork from 2.8 - 6.2\. This includes multiple breaking changes along with a large number of improvements and bug fixes. If you're upgrading from 2.7 to current make sure to read the whole changelog to make sure you're ready.

### Other Changes

- Added a new resource nginx_runit_cleanup has been introduced which stops the existing nginx runit service and removes the init files. This is now called automatically from the default recipe to cleanup an existing installation. This should make it possible for users to migrate from the 2.X release to the current w/o manual steps.
- Fixed compile failures on Fedora and any other distros released in the future which use GCC 7
- Added the .m3u8 mimetype
- Moved all files out of the files/default directory since this isn't required with Chef 12 and later
- Added ulimit to the nginx sysconfig file for RHEL platforms

## 6.2.0 (2017-09-12)

- Install basic configuration before starting the nginx service
- Correct documentation for `rate_limiting_backoff` attribute
- Phusion Passenger distro has pid file location in /run/nginx.pid
- [GH-92] add a test suite for passenger install
- Swap the maintainer files for a readme section
- Update nginx version [1.12.1] and checksum attributes for source installs
- Update versions and checksums for lua-nginx-module and echo-nginx-module
- Simplify repo logic and use HTTPS repos

## 6.1.1 (2017-06-08)

- Use multipackage installs in the pagespeed recipe to speed things up
- Several fixes for Amazon Linux on Chef 13+

## 6.1.0 (2017-06-07)

- Add attributes for setting the repository URLs
- Fix support for Amazon Linux repos on Chef 13+

## 6.0.3 (2017-06-05)

- Correctly compare nginx versions with multiple digits so 1.10 is properly recognized as coming after 1.2.

## 6.0.2 (2017-04-27)

- Resolve name conflicts in the resource

## 6.0.1 (2017-04-04)

- double quotes are unnecessary in lua configure flags

## 6.0.0 (2017-03-25)

### Breaking change

- Support for Runit as an init system has been removed. If you require runit you will need to pin to the 5.X cookbook release. We highly recommend using either systemd or upstart instead of Runit.

### Other changes

- Install nginx 1.10.3 for source based installs
- Remove freebsd cookbook from testing as it's not necessary anymore
- Bump OpenSSL to 1.0.2k

## 5.1.3 (2017-03-24)

- Update apache2 license string
- Add image/svg+xml to gzip_files defaults
- support `worker_shutdown_timeout` released in 1.11.11

## 5.1.2 (2017-03-14)

- Setup LD options to include /usr/local/lib for libluajit in search path and bump the lua version

## 5.1.1 (2017-03-02)

- Add WantedBy to systemd service file so it starts at boot
- Avoid a warning in nginx_site by moving the template check outside the resource
- Allow nginx_site to specify template as an array of templates

## 5.1.0 (2017-03-01)

- Support the load_module directive
- Test with Local Delivery and not Rake
- Remove EOL platforms from the kitchen configs

## 5.0.7 (2017-02-12)

- Fix Opsworks compatibility
- Resolve a Chef 13 deprecation warning

## 5.0.6 (2017-01-16)

- Rebuild shared library cache after installing luajit

## 5.0.5 (2017-01-09)

- Fix typo in the pagespeed recipe

## 5.0.4 (2017-01-04)

- Avoid deprecation warnings by only defining nginx service once

## 5.0.3 (2017-01-03)

- Add ability to write passenger log to another location
- Properly disable the default site with nginx.org packages

## 5.0.2 (2016-12-22)

- Requite the latest compat_resource

## 5.0.1 (2016-12-13)

- Use multipackage in pagespeed module recipe to speed up installs
- Simplify the distro repo setup logic to ensure we're using the correct repos under all conditions. Previously the upstream repo was being missed on Suse systems
- Determine pidfile location correctly via a helper so we correctly set pidfiles when using Upstream packages on Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04\. This involved removing the attribute for the pidfile location, which may cause issues if you relied on that attribute.
- Testing improvements to make sure all suites run and the suites are testing the correct conditions

## 5.0.0 (2016-12-07)

### Breaking changes

- Default to the upstream nginx.org repo for package installs. The official nginx repo gives an improved experience over outdated distro releases. This can be disabled via attribute if you'd like to remain on the distro packages.

### Other changes

- Add a deprecation warning when using runit
- Rewrite the readme usage section
- Better document how to compile modules

## 4.0.2 (2016-12-01)

- Default to openssl 1.0.2j with source installs
- Add cookbook property to the nginx_site resource to allow using templates defined in other cookbooks
- Prevent default docroot index.html on bad url in status
- Readme improvements

## 4.0.1 (2016-10-31)

- Fix a version check in the realip recipe
- Align the config with the default config a bit
- Fix the ChefSpec matchers now that nginx_site is a custom resource

## 4.0.0 (2016-10-31)

### Breaking changes

The nginx_site definition is now a custom_resource. This improves the overall experience and allows for notifications and reporting on resource updates. It does change the behavior in some circumstances however. Previously to disable a site you would set 'enable false' on your definition. This will still function, but will result in a deprecation warning. Instead you should use 'action :disable' since this is a real resource now.

### Other changes

- Avoid splitting on compile params in the ohai plugin, which resulted in some source installs attempting to install on every Chef run.
- Expanded testing and improved kitchen suite setup
- Improved documentation of attributes and cookbook usage

## 3.2.0 (2016-10-28)

- Reload nginx on site change

## 3.1.2 (2016-10-24)

- [GH-26] Remove guard on package[nginx] resource
- Fix pcre packages on RHEL that prevented pagespeed module compilation

## 3.1.1 (2016-09-21)

- Raise on error vs. Chef::Appliation.fatal
- Require compat_resource with notification fixes

## 3.1.0 (2016-09-14)

- Resolve FC023 warnings
- FreeBSD fixes
- Fail hard on unsupported platforms in the source recipe
- Install 'ca-certificates' packages with passenger
- Add `passenger_show_version_in_header` config
- Remove chef 11 compatibility
- Replace apt/yum deps with compat_resource
- Fix specs for freebsd source installs
- Remove apt recipe from the repo_passenger recipe
- Switch to += operator as << also incorrectly replaces text in root.

## 3.0.0 (2016-08-18)

### Breaking changes

Ideally we'd offer perfect backwards compatibility forever, but in order to maintain the cookbook going forward we've evaluated the current scope of the cookbook and removed lesser used functionality that added code complexity.

- The minimum chef-client version is now 12.1 or later, which will enables support for Ohai 7+ plugins, the ohai_plugin custom resource, and automatic init system discovery.
- Support for Gentoo has been removed. Gentoo lacks an official Chef package and there is no Bento image to use for Test Kitchen integration tests.
- Support for the bluepill init system has been removed. Usage of this init system has declined, and supporting it added a cookbook dependency as well as code complexity.
- Ubuntu source installs will no longer default to runit, and will instead use either Upstart or Systemd depending on the release of Ubuntu. You can still force the use of runit by setting default['nginx']['init_style'] to 'runit'. Runit was used historically before reliable init systems were shipped with Ubuntu. Both Upstart and Systemd have the concept of restarting on failure, which was the main reason for choosing Runit over sys-v init.

### Other changes

- Don't setup the YUM EPEL repo on Fedora as it's not needed
- Systemd based platforms will now use systemd by default for source installs
- Retry downloads of the nginx source file as the mirror sometimes fails to load
- Download the nginx source from the secure nginx.org site
- Updated the Ohai plugin to avoid deprecation notices and function better on non us-en locale systems
- Install source install pre-reqs using multi-package which speeds up Chef runs
- Add testing in Travis with Kitchen Dokken for full integration testing of each PR
- Add integration test on Chef 12.1 as well as the latest Chef to ensure compatibility with the oldest release we support
- Remove installation of apt-transport-https and instead increase the apt dependency to >= 2.9.1 which includes the installation of apt-transport-https
- Don't try to setup the nginx.org repo on Fedora as this will fail
- Better log when trying to setup repositories on unsupported platforms
- Fixed source_url and issue_url in the metadata to point to the correct URLs
- Removed Chef 10 compatibility code
- Chefspec platform updates and minor fixes
- Replace all usage of node.set with node.normal to avoid deprecation notices
- Remove the suse init script that isn't used anymore
- Speed up the specs with caching
- Move test attributes and runlists out the kitchen.yml files and into a test cookbook

## 2.9.0 (2016-08-12)

- Add support for Suse Nginx.org packages

## v2.8.0 (2016-08-12)

This is the first release of the nginx codebase under the chef_nginx namespace. We've chosen to bring this cookbook under the direction of the Community Cookbook Team, in order to ship a working 2.X release. The cookbook name has been changed, but all attributes are the same and compatibility has been maintained. After this 2.8.0 release we will release 3.0 as a Chef 12+ version of the cookbook and then work to add additional custom resources for managing nginx with wrapper cookbooks. Expect regular releases as we march towards a resource driven model.

- Removed the restrictive version constraints for cookbook dependencies that prevented users from utilizing new functionality. Ohai has been pinned to < 4.0 to allow for Chef 11 compatibility, but other cookbooks have no upper limit
- Updated all modules in the source install to their latest releases
- Removed the GeoIP database checksums as these files are constantly updates and this causes Chef run failures
- Updated OpenSSL for source installs to 1.0.1t
- Updated the source install of Nginx to version 1.10.1
- Updated the ohai recipe to install a Ohai 7+ compatible plugin on systems running Ohai 7+
- Fixed installation of Passenger version 5.X+
- Added a http_v2_module recipe
- Replaced node.set usage with node.normal to avoid deprecation warnings
- Removed the apt version pin in the Berkfile that wasn't necessary and constrained the apt version
- Removed the lua-devel package install from the lua recipe that failed chef runs and wasn't necessary
- Removed duplicate packages from the source module installs
- Added a dependency on the yum cookbook which was missing from the metadata
- Updated the mime.types file and added the charset_types configuration option to the nginx config
- Added source_url, issue_url, and chef_version metadata
- Fixed the pid file attribute logic for Ubuntu 16.04
- Removed the Contributing doc that was for contributing to Opscode cookbooks
- Updated all test dependencies in the Gemfile
- Removed default user/group/mode declarations from resources for simplicity
- Updated documentation for dependencies in the README
- Added a chefignore file to limit the cookbook files that are uploaded to the chef server and speed up cookbook syncs to nodes
- Added additional platforms to the Test Kitchen config and removed the .kitchen.cloud.yml file
- Switched integration tests to Inspec and fixed several non-functional tests
- Switched from Rubocop to Cookstyle and resolved all warnings
- Added the standard Chef Rakefile for simplified testing
- Updated Chefspecs to avoid constant deprecation warnings and converge using chef-zero on a newer Debian 8 system
- Switch Travis CI testing to use ChefDK instead of RVM/Gem installs
- Removed testing dependencies from the Gemfile as testing should be performed via ChefDK. Release gems are still in the Gemfile as they are not shipped with ChefDK
- Added a maintainers.md doc and updated the contributing/testing docs to point to the Chef docs
- Removed Guard as guard-foodcritic doesn't support the latest release which makes guard incompatible with ChefDK
